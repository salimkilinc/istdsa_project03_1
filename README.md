In the third project of Istanbul Data Science Academy's Data Science Bootcamp, we worked with an unbalanced dataset. This is my hobby project in which I worked on a balanced dataset in addition to the third project.
In this project, which I call 'Red Wine Quality Classifier', according to the scenario, a luxury restaurant asked me to develop an application that predicts whether the quality of red wine is Low or High based on some wine data in a database.
You can check out the whole analysis by reviewing the project notebook and the python file or you can read my article on Medium for explanations:
You can also use the model I trained in this project as a streamlit application: https://redwine.streamlit.app/
